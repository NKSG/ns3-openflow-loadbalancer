ns3-openflow-loadbalancer
=========================

This is a ns-3 simulation of an OpenFlow load balancer. A course project for 13 Fall UC Davis ECS 252.



Laboratory/Project/Term Paper:
Students work individually or in small groups on a course project. The projects will complement and extend the lecture material. The project may include: (1) implementation of a network protocol, or (2) proposal/design of a new protocol or extension of an existing one followed by its evaluation via computer simulation (and mathematical analysis, whenever possible). Students therefore gain hands-on experience in network protocol design, development, and analysis.
